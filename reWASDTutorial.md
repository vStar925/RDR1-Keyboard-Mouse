### reWASD Setup

1.) [Download and install reWASD](https://www.rewasd.com/). If it is running, right click reWASD in the system tray and exit it.

2.) Make sure C:\Users\Public\Documents\reWASD ***does NOT exist***. If it does, delete the reWASD folder. 

***Note the actual path will probably say Public Documents, not Documents. That's fine, Documents, Public Documents... they are the same.***

6. Make sure your mouse and keyboard are setup as a virtual controller. Look for the keyboard icons on the bottom left. Hover over them to see their names. When you find the one you're using, right click and group it with your mouse in the pop-up window and close.

7.) reWASD and the config should now be setup. Make sure the config is off (the power button is not yellow). Start RDR1 in Xenia as normal with a controller. Once in game, alt-tab to reWASD and click the power button. Go back to the game and you should have mouse and keyboard controls.
