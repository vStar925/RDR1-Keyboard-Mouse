## Requirements
- [ReWASD](https://www.rewasd.com/)
- [RDR Modding Tools](https://archive.org/details/red-dead-redemption-modding-tools.-7z)

## Instructions

### Swapping Files

1.) Follow Sections II and III of this guide for detailed instructions on exploring the game files (https://github.com/vStar925/Red-Dead-Redemption-1-Modding)

2.) In "RDR1 KBM Mod\files to replace", search for all 3 files inside rdr2_layer0.rpf with MagicRDR and replace them with their respective files in this folder (Right click, replace) Save and exit MagicRDR.

### Importing reWASD Profile

*Installing manually if the below doesn't work for some reason **[here](https://github.com/vStar925/RDR1-Keyboard-Mouse/blob/main/reWASDTutorial.md).**

1.) After downloading the KBM mod, navigate to the reWASD config folder and open each folder until you see the four .rewasd files. Double-click one or all of them and a window will open in reWASD.

## Hiding the Mouse Cursor (optional)

Since are you using a mouse in Xenia, the cursor will stay on screen while playing. Somehow, I didn't find this all that distracting but if you're interested in hiding it, follow these steps.

1.) [Download this invisible cursor](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-detail/23254) and save it to C:\Windows\Cursors

2.) Press the Windows key and type "cursor" and open the first result. Go to the pointers tab.

2.) Double-click "Normal select" and replace it with the invisible cursor. Save As... (Xenia, RDR, etc.). Apply.

3.) Select the scheme whenever you want to play RDR with this setup and switch back to None to return the cursor to normal.
