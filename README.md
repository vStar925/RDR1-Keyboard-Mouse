## Requirements
- [ReWASD](https://pcsx2.net/](https://www.rewasd.com/)https://www.rewasd.com/)
- [RDR Modding Tools](https://archive.org/details/red-dead-redemption-modding-tools.-7z)

## Instructions

1. Follow Sections II and III of this guide for detailed instructions on exploring the game files (https://github.com/vStar925/Red-Dead-Redemption-1-Modding)

2. In "RDR1 KBM Mod\files to replace", search for all 3 files inside rdr2_layer0.rpf with MagicRDR and replace them with their respective files in this folder (Right click, replace) Save and exit MagicRDR.

3. Copy the Users folder inside reWASD config directly to your C:/ Drive (default reWASD profiles folder)

4. (This may not need to be done, I'm not sure. Putting it here just in case) In reWASD on the bottom left, right click your keyboard and "Group with other devices" and group it with your mouse.

Note: If you've previously played the game with a controller, you'll have to start the game with it. After you load, alt-tab over to reWASD and enable the config.
Note2: The mouse doesn't function as mouse when the config is enabled. To turn it off, press the Windows key to show the taskbar, then hold the ` key to use the mouse as normal. Click the power icon in reWASD to turn it off.
