## Instructions

### 1.) reWASD Setup

*If you haven't already installed reWASD, do that now and run it at least once*

1.) Download and extract the latest release. Inside, open folder 1. Double-click any or all of the configs to add them to reWASD (You can switch between them at any time within reWASD)

2.) [Group your mouse and keyboard in reWASD](https://help.rewasd.com/how-to-remap/group-of-devices.html)

### 2.) Swapping Files

*Make sure you have downloaded and extracted [RDR Modding Tools](https://archive.org/details/red-dead-redemption-modding-tools.-7z) before continuing*

1.) [Follow Sections II and III of this guide to understand the basics of replacing files](https://github.com/vStar925/Red-Dead-Redemption-1-Modding)

2.) Inside *KBM Mod\2.) Replace ALL of these files with MagicRDR*, search for all 4 of these files inside rdr2_layer0.rpf with MagicRDR and replace them with their respective files in this folder (Right click, replace) Save and exit MagicRDR.

*Note: You do NOT need to repack the extracted iso file after replacing files. You can run the modified game by opening default.xex directly inside Xenia*

### 3.) Hiding the Mouse Cursor (optional)

Since are you using a mouse in Xenia, the cursor will stay on screen while playing. Somehow, I didn't find this all that distracting but if you're interested in hiding it, follow these steps.

1.) [Download this invisible cursor](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-detail/23254) and save it to C:\Windows\Cursors

2.) Press the Windows key and type "cursor" and open the first result. Go to the pointers tab.

2.) Double-click "Normal select" and replace it with the invisible cursor. Save As... (Xenia, RDR, etc.). Apply.

3.) Select the scheme whenever you want to play RDR with this setup and switch back to None to return the cursor to normal.
